# R-Code-Sample

This code sample offers a simple analysis of the Work, Family, and Health Survey (WFHS). This survey 
tests the effectiveness of an intervention that aims to reduce work-family conflict. While the WFHS Public Use Data is rather robust (though it does exclude measures of health outcomes), this analysis will focus on
employee choice/agency and family-supportive supervisor behaviors. 

The following questions guide this analysis:
1. Is there a correlation between an employee's degree of choice over their work hours and 
    the degree of family-supportive supervisor behaviors (FSSB) in their workplace?
2. If such a correlation exists, how does the intervention affect it?

I ran a correlation test for each wave for treatment and control, resulting in a total of 8 correlation
tests. Every test had a significant result.

Since every test had a significant result, I then plotted all the correlation coefficients (separated
into treatment and control groups) to visualize how the correlation between employee choice/agency and 
family-supportive supervisor behaviors changed over time. In all cases, the correlation coefficient was positive, meaning that as one variable increased, so did the other.

The correlation coefficient was similar for both groups at the baseline. However, in every subsequent time period, the treatment group had a greater correlation coefficient than the control group. This may indicate that the intervention was successful in fostering a work environment that was more conducive to work-family balance.
