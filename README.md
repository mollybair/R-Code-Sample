# R-Code-Sample

This code sample offers a simple analysis of the Work, Family, and Health Survey (WFHS). This survey 
tests the effectiveness of an intervention that aims to reduce work-family conflict. While the WFHS Public Use Data is rather robust (though it does exclude measures of health outcomes), this analysis will focus on
employee choice/agency and family-supportive supervisor behaviors. 

The following questions guide this analysis:
1. Is there a correlation between an employee's degree of choice over their work hours and 
    the degree of family-supportive supervisor behaviors (FSSB) in their workplace?
2. If such a correlation exists, how does the intervention affect it?
